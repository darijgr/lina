# Notes on linear algebra

These are lecture notes for an introductory linear algebra class
([Math 4242 at the University of Minneapolis, Fall
2016](http://www.math.umn.edu/~dgrinber/4242/)).
They are far from finished (at the moment, not even Gaussian
elimination is in!), but eventually should cover basics (classes
of matrices, row echelon form, vector spaces, linear maps,
quadratic forms?) and possibly include tutorials on matrix
computations inside [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/).
They, however, already go beyond the class in some aspects
(the sections marked with an asterisk in their title are non-class
material).

Up-to-date PDF files can be downloaded from the class website:
